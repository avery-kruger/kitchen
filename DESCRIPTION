Description: kitchen allows for the implementation of a machine learning technique
    called convolutional kitchen sinks or convolutional random features. Using a Gaussian
    matrix, it produces a set of random features from data than can be effectively used for 
    machine learning. The package includes tools for producing features, training and testing 
    models, and predicting from models.
